# The Fear of Being Unoriginal: Rethinking Creativity and Inspiration

I’ve been thinking a lot lately about creativity, and more specifically — my strange relationship with it.  
And to be honest?  
I’m not sure why being **unoriginal** feels like my style.

I don’t mean that in a self-deprecating way (or maybe I do). I just… copy things. Not in a malicious way (but maybe in a lazy way), but in a way that feels natural. I see things out there — captions, visuals, moods, aesthetics — and I stitch them together into something that feels like me.

But at the same time, I can’t help but wonder:

> Is that why nothing I’ve done has really been “successful”?

## The Worship of Originality

We grow up being taught that originality is the holy grail of creativity.  
That the best ideas come like lightning bolts — sudden, brilliant, and born from nothing.  
That true creatives just “come up with things,” effortlessly.

So when I sit with a blank page and my brain feels… empty, I feel broken.  
When my ideas feel like echoes of something I’ve already seen, I feel fake.

But maybe I’ve been looking at it all wrong.

## Nothing Comes From Nothing

That’s the truth no one tells you.

Everything is influenced by something.  
Every “original” idea is a remix, a reframe, a reinterpretation.

That thing I do — the one I almost brushed off earlier?  
Taking things from different places, combining them, and making them feel like mine?

That’s not cheating.  
That’s a skill.  
Actually, that’s a **superpower**.

## You’re Not a Copycat — You’re a Curator

Think of it like this:

* A **DJ** doesn’t write the music. They mix tracks to create a whole new vibe.
    
* A **chef** doesn’t invent tomatoes or garlic. But they combine ingredients into flavors no one’s ever tasted.
    
* A **filmmaker** like *Tarantino* borrows entire shots, songs, and moods — but no one calls his work “unoriginal.”
    
* Even **Shakespeare** stole most of his plots. Seriously.
    

The originality isn’t in the raw materials.  
It’s in the **combination**.  
The **decisions**.  
The **curation**.  
The **point of view**.

That “make it like mine” part? That’s where your real voice lives.

## Maybe the Fear Is the Real Problem

So why hasn’t this approach led to success yet?

Maybe it’s not the **method**.  
Maybe it’s the **mindset**.  
Maybe I’ve been holding back. Hesitating. Not finishing projects. Not posting.

All because I was afraid someone would point and say:

> “That looks familiar.”

But you know what?  
Of course it does.  
The pieces are familiar. But the way I put them together? That’s never been done before.  
Not by me. Not by anyone.

## Owning It

So here’s my new plan:

I’m done apologizing for not being “original” enough.  
I’m done waiting for lightning to strike.

Instead, I’m going to **own the way I work**.

I’m a collector.  
A remixer.  
A filter.  
A mirror of the world I admire — but in my own language.

Because originality doesn’t mean inventing the wheel.  
It means **rolling it in your own direction**.

And maybe success isn’t about having the most groundbreaking idea.  
Maybe it’s just about having the courage to **share your version of it**.
