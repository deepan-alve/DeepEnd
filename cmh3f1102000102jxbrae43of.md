A man who lived in the dark and became the night , once taught me how to live in the light .

> *“****Why do we fall, Bruce?*** ***So we can learn to pick ourselves up.”***

I’ve read and watched countless books and movies, but nothing — **nothing** — has ever fucking hit me the way **BATMAN** has. He wasn’t just a person….. **He was a symbol.**

A symbol of **Fear**. Of **Vengeance**. Of **Resilience**.

## **The Dark night :**

> “Who you are in the dark defines you more than who you are in the light.”

Life fucks everyone equally. Some get abandoned. Some get broken. Some watch their world they built, burn on fire before their eyes , But that doesn’t mean it’s over . That doesn’t mean you have the damn right to end your own life.

Pain is real. Loss is real. But so is the fight.

Superman the unstoppable force, the god among men. The world bows before him. But Batman? **Batman doesn’t bow.** When things went south , When Man of Steel came down to take him down . The man didn’t flinch .Batman didn’t just fight. **He made the god bleed.**

***He made the GOD fall to his knees.***

Because that’s what Batman is. **Not power. Not luck. Just will.** The will to not give up no matter . The Undying Hope . Sheer Madness to just walk without looking down .

This few pages of comic changed my view to life drastically . I never got angry again in my life easily . I never gave up when everything went into the hell . I did let some assholes bother me from time to time but just kept moving forward hoping for smtg that never is certain.

But life isn’t a comic book. There are no dramatic panels, no epic scores in the background, no Alfred waiting with a cup of Mulligatawny soup and some wise words when you break. There’s just you. And the silence. The weight of your choices.

I’ve stood in that silence. I’ve felt the weight. It’s crushing. It makes you want to scream, to disappear, to stop existing just for a damn moment. And I get it. I know how it feels when everything turns to shit, when the people you trusted walk away, when the dreams you built come crashing down like they were never real to begin with. I know how it feels to sit in a room full of people and still feel alone, to go to bed hoping you that everything becomes la la land the next day .

yet, here I am. Still **standing**. Still **breathing**. Still **fighting**……………**Because I refuse to be erased.**

## **Does God Bleed ?**

I am no atheist . But I don’t accept that we have a fate on which we live . I am believer that our life is based on what we have done and what will we do . It sometimes may also depend on what a man can do in Antarctica . Everything is interconnected but nothing is connected to a string called Fate. Yea the higher power may influence somethings but not everything. So stop blaming him for your reaps of choices that you and other humans made on this mother earth .

***So to my question Do God Bleed ?***  
**YEP . He will bleed . I am sure** . Each time a man/woman hangs himself whatever may the reason be . I am sure he bleeds .

## **No Man’s Land:**

I think we are all part of a goddamn horror movie, and guess what? **We’re all the main characters. We don’t die but we suffer.**But here’s the thing about No Man’s Land — **you either fight or you fade. And I? I fight.**

I know I am out complaining about my life that I have gone through shit but I am not sure I have gone through as much as others but i have gone through pretty terrible stuff and I am not here anymore to justify my pain.

I’ve had my Good days and also my worst . But quitting is not in my script and never will be . If I ever go out, it won’t be because I “gave up.” Nah. **It’ll be murder. Straight-up a thriller for y’all to find out .** Because I don’t tap out. I don’t die. I **get the hell back up.**

So if you’re at your lowest, standing at the edge , being at No Man’s land thinking it’s game over — **it’s not.** You’re just in the middle of your arc. And trust me, the best scenes are yet to come.

**Stay. Fight. Live.Peace — Deepan**

*By the way Mulligatawny soup is Batman’s favorite drink and its a Tamil dish. Chicken Rasam basically .*
